I'm a 4th year PhD candidate in Applied Math at the University of Washington advised by [Bamdad Hosseini](https://bamdadhosseini.org/) and [Sasha Aravkin](https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/). I work on problems in optimal transport and variational analysis with applications in machine learning. I'm also a graduate student researcher at the [IHME](https://www.healthdata.org/) developing better statistical methods for aggregating large scale longitudinal data to improve estimates in global health. 

Previously, I did a joint bachelors/masters at Claremont McKenna College and Claremont Graduate University, majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science, and obtaining a masters in Applied and Computational Mathematics. In the past, I've worked on covering problems in discrete geometry and theoretical neuroscience from the lens of recurrent networks.
