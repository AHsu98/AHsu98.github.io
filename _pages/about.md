I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Applied Math at the University of Washington advised by [Bamdad Hosseini](https://bamdadhosseini.org/) and [Sasha Aravkin](https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/). I work on problems in optimal transport and variational analysis with applications in machine learning. I also work with the [IHME](https://www.healthdata.org/) to develop better statistical methods for aggregating large scale longitudinal data to improve estimates in global health. 

Previously, I did a joint bachelors/masters at Claremont McKenna College and Claremont Graduate University, majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science, and obtaining a masters in Applied and Computational Mathematics. In th past, I've worked on covering problems in discrete geometry and theoretical neuroscience from the lens of recurrent networks.
